single cell multi-omics

Recent advances in molecular biology and genomics have enabled the development of powerful techniques that allow for the simultaneous analysis of a cell's epigenome and transcriptome. These methods have revolutionized our understanding of how gene expression is regulated and how epigenetic modifications contribute to cellular function and disease.
